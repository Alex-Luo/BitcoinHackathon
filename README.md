  SMS implimentation to receive your Coinbase balance.
  <br>
</p>
## Issues
Currently, to make the code work you must run the program in terminal and have it continuous run the loop. Once the loop is going, if you send a text message to your email address, you'll then get your account balance and transaction rates.
## Future Plans
I hope to create a server to actually recieve in messages from the phone and get rid of the email system that is set up currently.

## Installing Coinbase and Libraries
 ```shell
 sudo pip install Coinbase
```
 <br>
 <br>
 The code also has additional libaries, most of which will need to be installed. Extra libaries can be installed as such
```shell
sudo pip install "library_name"
 ```
 <br>

## Changing Variables

  <br>
  In original code for the Hackathon, we converted to MUR based off the dollar. To conver to any other currency, do your currency times conversion rate of other currency.

  Change the api key linked to the coinbase wallet to your api wallet key.

  Here you link your number and email. Realize your service providor may be different when sending a message to an email account.

## Usage
Currently the program only works if you run it off terminal and leave it looping. While it loops, if you send a text message to your email,
you will recieve your account balance back.
